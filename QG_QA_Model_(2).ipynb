            "[<Document: {'content': \"\\nhello everyone so welcome to this data science roadmap and in this session i'm going to talk about how to do a\\npreparation for a data science uh data science is one of the hottest skill you can say uh nowadays\\nand most of us are trying to prepare for a data science industry but some of us are able to make a transition\\nor we are able to get into a data science industry easily and some of us\\nare facing uh some sort of issue and yes that is that is very very common and it happens with all of us nothing new right\\nso not even a data science so let's suppose if i'm trying to uh get into any other industry so for sure i'll have to do a\\npreparation and according to my industry i have to adopt a couple of things i\\nhave to learn couple of things and i have to do a couple of projects so here in this roadmap i'm going to talk\\nabout that how to do that preparation what and all things are required what and all things are not required even if\\nthings are required but till what extent we are not supposed to get a mastery\\ninto each and everything this is not our industry expectations right for sure you all or we all will be able to work if i\\nknow about a couple of things and this is something which i'm going to discuss in my data science roadmap i have\\ndivided this entire things into a four segment so first of all i will be\\ntalking about uh fresher so zero year experience to a two year experienced person how they will be able\\nto get into a data science industry and what in all kind of preparations they are supposed to do and then two to five\\nyear five to eight year and eight plus year this is how i have divided this entire road map in a very clear way so\\nthat you all will be able to get an advantage of these things and if you are\\ngoing to do a preparation according to these things which i'm going to discuss believe me\\nanyone will be able to get into this industry it's not tough the only thing is we have to structure ourselves we\\nshould know that what we are supposed to study and what we are supposed to leave otherwise if you will just keep on\\nstudying something uh there is no limitation right there is no limitation after some time you will feel\\nfrustrated and you will say that no uh it's it's not it's not something which i can do but no that is not a fact\\neveryone can do it right either you you are from a tech background or maybe from you are from a dante background but\\nyes it is possible to do all of these things so fine guys let's talk about a\\nvery first segment a junior data scientist let's suppose if i'm a fresher right\\nand if i'm willing to get into a data science industry then what in all preparations i'm supposed to do as a\\njunior data scientist here as you can see so in my slide i have mentioned that you are supposed to aware about a\\ncomputer science fundamentals right when i say computer science fundamental means about an operating system which is very\\nvery important and i believe nowadays most of us are aware about it 90 plus people are aware about it a computer\\nscience fundamental uh linux i have mentioned over here a basic terminal uses i have mentioned over here what is\\napi again not in depth just as an overview i'm supposed to aware about all\\nof these terms right so this is the only requirement that we have over here now\\ncoming to this part now this part is very very very very important for all of\\nus as a fresher so if i'm a fresher i'll try to focus more and more on\\nprogramming and coding side even if i don't know about a programming or a\\ncoding even if i have no interest in programming and coding but still that is\\na requirement and here we have python one of the best\\nlanguage one of the best library available so far on this planet to learn\\nit's very very easy as well as compared to a c c plus plus java scala or any\\nother languages you will be able to find out that python is one of the best and\\none of the easiest possible language exists on this planet so it's not tough\\nto learn even if you are coming from a non-tech background let's suppose a civil background or mechanical\\nbackground i don't say that as a non-tech but yeah it's a people's perspective i'm just talking about it\\nright uh we we all have done let's suppose uh engineering or bca mca that's\\ncompletely fine right so at least we have studied some sort of a tech so i i just like uh keep every one\\nof them into uh tech itself but still there are some people who say that i'm coming from a non-tech background civil\\nmechanical electrical according to me it's tech so yeah\\nmoving ahead so programming is important for sure so you are supposed to be aware about the programming now again if i'll\\ntalk about a python programming so there are couple of library like python basic is important oops concept in python is\\nimportant logging exception handling modular programming all of these things\\nare very very important as we have mentioned over here object oriented programming numpy is important pandas is\\nimportant so all of these libraries are very very very very important again\\nwhenever you are trying to do a coding whenever you are trying to learn coding always try to take a piece of data and\\nthen try to do some sort of implementation some sort of exploration on top of those data this is the way to\\nlearn programming because see again if i'll talk about libraries and of\\nfunctions or apis which is available inside a particular library so it's kind of ocean you will not be able to\\nmemorize you will not be able to remember each and everything so the best possible way to learn any kind of a code\\nor any kind of a programming is just try to solve some sort of use cases\\ninitially yes you are going to face a problem and yes we all face a kind of a problem every time right so whenever we\\nare trying to learn something new it's a human behavior it's a human nature right but still\\nif you are going to practice for a couple of weeks i'm not talking about uh years or maybe a six month or ten month\\ni'm just saying that if you are going to practice if you will keep on solving uh some sort of a problem on a regular\\nbasis right some sort of a real problem on a regular basis so for sure you will be able to learn each and everything in\\na best possible way and this is something that we have included inside your data science master's course which\\nis available inside your one neuron tech neuron segment so data science masters i\\nwill be talking about it right so in data science masters course this is designed in a way that you will be able\\nto see each and everything in a similar sequences so let me show you so how this data science masters\\ncurriculum looks like and where from where you will be able to learn this programming so here is a data science\\nmasters if i'm going to search a data science master so this is the course that we have designed for you and let's\\nsuppose if i'm going to click on any of these videos so here you will be able to find out a python basic you will be able\\nto find out oops concept you will be able to find out a concept of databases pandas numpy matplotli plotley c bond\\nedas so everything is already available and the way i'm going to discuss a\\nsequences so you can try to explore things in a similar way you can try to practice in a similar way and believe me\\nit's very very easy after doing a couple of week of like a practice so i believe\\nit's it's easy to do it now so here i have mentioned our programming language\\nas well but keep one thing in your mind either go for python or go for r\\nif i'll talk about industry so 95 plus people are using python programming\\nif i'll just talk about two segments r and python so if i'll try to do a comparison between i'm not talking about\\nall the languages so uh don't take me wrong over there so if i'll talk about a segment who is using either python or r\\nso it's 95 is to one so it's always better to go for a python and it's\\nactually very very easy right you will start taking an interest once you will start like solving some sort of a\\nproblem with the help of python and you will find out that yes now it's very easy i can do it easily right so either\\ngo for python or are not for a two programming languages at a\\ntime i'm not going to advise you to learn a multiple programming language in a first place if you are able to learn\\npython and then if you are going to explore any languages right you are not\\nsupposed to put up a similar kind of effort easily you all will be able to learn it it's very very easy because\\nsyntax is the only thing which is going to change if suppose if i have learned python and then if i'm going to explore\\njava so it is not going to give you like a lot of pain you will be able to adopt you will be able to even write a code\\nand again you are not supposed to reinvent a wheel from a very scratch right so always try to focus on single\\nlanguage that will be better now if i'll talk about uh query languages so sql\\nright so yes little bit of sql is required for sure because at the end of the day you\\nare going to deal with lots and lots of data set and that data set will be available in some sql system or maybe in\\nsome no sql system or maybe in some file system so yes sql is important and you\\nare supposed to know a basic of it if you are fresher it's better it's better\\nto have an idea about a sequel so that you will be able to perform a multiple things you will be able to build an\\napplication and you will be able to deploy something in a production server now coming to the next\\nsegment right so here database fundamental i was talking about sql so yes database\\nfundamental is very very important because without databases you will not be able\\nto build any industry grade application anywhere believe me so that is the\\nreason this databases are very very important so i have mentioned a multiple databases\\nover here but if i'm aware about one equal system and\\none no sql system that is more than enough if i'll talk about a sequel again\\nmy sequel postgres sequel maria db db so sorry so like uh there are many databases\\nwhich is available so again you're not supposed to explore each and every database that's completely fine again if\\ni'll talk about a nosql so initially it will be better if you are having an idea about a mongodb again easy to learn easy\\nto explore this one right so one from a sequel and one from a nosql db you are\\nsupposed to learn and again as and when it is required so let's suppose i have joined the organization and there is a\\nrequirement for an implementation of a cassandra over there or maybe an hbase\\nor maybe a graph db so yes you will be able to do an implementation if you are\\naware about at least one from this segment and one from other segment you will be able to explore and you will be\\nable to implement with no time so one sequel is very very important whenever\\nyou are trying to interact with the sequel so always try to interact with a python api python is a powerful language\\nthat provides you a driver that provides you an api to connect with any kind of a sql system and any kind of a nosql\\nsystem so always try to learn in that way and same thing we have discussed even inside your data science masters\\nagain mastery is not required keep these things in your mind if you will think that first of all i'll\\ntry to get a mastery into a sequel and no sequel and then i will move ahead my advice to you will be no it is not\\nrequired right if you have a basic understanding if you are able to consume\\na data set from a sql system to your like a current machine learning system that you are going to build on a\\nstatistical analysis system that you are trying to build that is more than enough and it's completely fine then coming to the next\\nsegment as we all know that basic of mathematics is required right as a data\\nscientist and many people try to focus just on mathematics\\nthat so again i'll give you one piece of advice over here that mathematics is required but not for all\\njob not for all job which exists inside a data science so\\nthere will be another video inside this uh roadmap you will be able to find out so\\nwhere i'm just talking about a data industry so how data industry is divided so you can try to watch that particular\\nvideo and i think you will be able to get a neat and clean understanding about it so mathematics is required but again\\na similar kind of a mathematics that we all have studied in our 9th and 11th or 12th right again not all kind of a\\nmathematics is required so basic of linear algebra algebraic equation right\\na basic of calculus a differential calculus is required a basic of statistics and basic of probability so\\nthese are the only thing which is required again don't think of doing a phds because math is again an ocean you\\nwill just uh like keep on solving a mathematical problem but you will not be\\nable to get an end of it so it's better to have a basic idea about a linear\\nalgebra a descriptive statistics in financial statistics probability right\\nor some sort of a calculus now these segments is going to help you out to\\nunderstand a machine learning algorithm theoretically and when you will try to\\ndo a practical implementation right so these things these mathematics will help\\nyou out to understand that whether i'm going into a right direction or i'm\\ngoing into a wrong direction when you will try to explore a data when you will try to build a relationship in between a\\ndata even at that point of a time mathematical concepts are going to help you out and it's it's more like a\\nkind of uh i would say uh like uh exploring uh things it's more\\nlike a kind of a building a perspective about the data so where this mathematical\\nthings is going to help you out right now after this there is an instruction\\nthat we have mentioned so once you are able to reach out to this till this label it simply means that that you have\\ncompleted python you have completed a db you have completed apis and you have completed a basic of mathematics part\\nnow if you have completed a basic of mathematics part now you can start building your network so even these\\npiece of advice is mentioned inside your roadmap you can start joining a data\\nscience community there are so many communities you will be able to find out over a linkedin uh over a facebook insta\\neverywhere you will be able to find out a multiple data science community now why i'm asking you to join a community\\nthere is a reason behind this one the reason is very very simple so see\\nyou are trying to get into our industry but you are not having any kind of idea that what i will be able to get when i'm\\ngoing to join this industry and that's true so when you will see a different people uh with a different different mindset a\\ndifferent different geographical location with a different different perspective at that point of a time so you can start\\nbuilding your own perspective that okay which one is required which one is not required uh you will start evaluating\\nyourself and this is where community is important you can start joining a data\\nscience community you can start exploring a perspective of a different different people persons\\nand yes accordingly you can start talking about or data science or maybe\\nyou can start exploring about a data science this is where this start joining a data science community comes into a\\npicture now here once you are done with a little bit of mathematical concept then you are\\nsupposed to do what so then try to focus on data analysis now inside this data analysis you are supposed to learn\\nfeature engineering data wrangling and then eda exploratory data analysis\\nand then you can start writing a article this part is again important so you can start writing article so that you will\\nbe able to build your public profile building a public profile showcasing a\\nwork to someone is very very important nowadays because let's suppose if i have a resume and if i'm not able to showcase\\nmy work no one will be able to believe or no one will give me a call because uh\\nmaybe like uh there is some alternate profile that they will be able to get where people\\nare showcasing all of their experiences all the expertise that they have so articles are very very important again\\nwhile you will write an article so when you will write an article so at that point of time uh you will be able\\nto see that yes i'm able to get some sort of a hold on top of a particular\\ntopic and that is the reason so we have mentioned start writing an article section over here you can try to focus\\non baby scrapping better scrapping is again important things because every time it's not like you will be able to\\nget a data in an excel seat or maybe in a csv or maybe in some other document it's like sometimes so we have to scrap\\na data from an internet from some website from some server or something right at that point of a time bib\\nscrapping is very very important and yes we all are going to use bevel scrapping\\neven in our professional life so i believe you are supposed to aware about this baby scrapping things and which is\\ngoing to help you out to build your next project and to do a multiple things at that point of a time so that is the\\nreason so we have mentioned that okay fine so try to do uh bev scrapping and uh it is it is going to hit you it is\\ngoing to give you some sort of advantages in some way and then you can start talking about machine learning\\nnow inside this masinali section so again we can try to divide these entire things into a multiple segment there are\\nhundreds of machine learning algorithm but you are not supposed to learn\\nmathematical concept and implementation for each and every algorithm there are some lists which i'll give you\\nso machine learning algorithm wise so yes there is something called a supervised machine learning there is\\nsomething called as unsupervised there is something called as like a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm which is a combination of\\nsupervised and unsupervised again inside supervised you will be able to find out regression you can find out a\\nclassification again inside a regression there are a multiple algorithm inside a\\nclassification again there are multiple algorithm so at least a basic algorithm\\nor a very very common algorithm we all are supposed to know again it's not like\\nthese other algorithm you are going to learn maybe 10 set of algorithm you are going to learn and\\nyou will be able to do each and every task for your entire life no that is not true but\\nwhy i'm advising you to learn only 10 there is a reason behind it so these\\nbasic 10 algorithm let's suppose i'm aware about a linear regression a multi-linear regression\\nand then i'm talking so i'm aware about a polynomial regression i'm aware about a ris i'm aware about lasso in\\nclassification segments so let's suppose i'm talking about uh like svm svr logistic decision tree\\nrandom forest so there are again multiple algorithm which you will be able to find out on this particular\\nsegment classification segment so if you are aware about these algorithm it's well and good it's more than enough\\nyou're not supposed to like uh think that okay fine so i'll not be able to explore i will not be able to understand\\nother algorithm no when time will come when it will be required you will be able to understand you will be able to\\nexplore now there are some algorithm from a clustering site like a cabin clustering hierarchy clustering or\\ndbs scan so these are the basic clustering algorithm that we are supposed to know if i'm talking about a\\ndimensional reduction so pca ldas so tsne so these are the things that we are\\nsupposed to know from this particular segment plus performance matrix is wise performs metrics for a classification\\nalgorithm regression algorithm as well as clustering algorithm so we are supposed to know at any point of a time\\nwhich is very very important plus hyper parameter tuning so if i'm aware about a\\ncouple of machine learning algorithm from this supervised unsupervised or semi supervised segment i'm well and\\ngood so when i'm saying that you are supposed to aware about a machine learning algorithm i simply mean that\\nthat theoretically mathematically as well as in a practical way\\nyou are supposed to aware about all of these algorithm it's not like if i just know about the theoretical things about\\na machine learning someone is going to give me a job no this that is not going to happen because people are going to\\nhire you companies are going to hire you so that you can productionize something you will be able to build or deliver\\nsomething to their client right so unless and until you are not going to explore these things still deployment\\nhow to do a deployment how to host a machine learning model how to like do a\\nretraining and all those things how to build a complete pipeline for a machine learning implementation how to dockerize\\nthis machine learning algorithm or how to build a complete ci cd pipeline for a\\nparticular project i believe your knowledge is going to be a partial or it's going to be half so\\nyou are supposed to focus on end to end deployment of a machine learning algorithm if you are just aware about 10\\nmuslin algorithm that's completely fine no one is going to complain but if you know just uh if you know hundreds of\\nmachine learning algorithm but just a theory of it it is not going to help you out right so 10 is better than 100 but\\nthose 10 till deployment this is the expectations of a market\\nnow after this for sure you will be able to get a confidence and you can start participating in a hackathon so again\\nthere are multiple companies even i don't keep on conducting a hackathons right so you can start participating in\\na hackathon and you will be able to win some of the hackathon i think that is going to boost your confidence for sure\\nright now there are like uh again machine learning algorithm which we have mentioned over there so you can try to\\nexplore maybe ensemble technique or machine learning advanced technique a boosting approach time series again you\\ncan try to explore with the help of machine learning you can try to build a machine learning recommendation system\\nyou can try to like uh develop some sort of a recommendation system for some of the website or some\\nof the businesses that is completely fine now after machine learning so you can start reading a research paper if\\nyou want again this is not mandatory but yeah try to explore some sort of a research paper and this is what we have\\nmentioned over there and then you can try to explore a little bit of deep learning\\nagain deep learning is not required in very depth but it's better it's better to have it right it's better to have it\\nat least a basic of it again inside a deep learning there are multiple libraries which is available like a pie\\ntorch keras or tensorflow so it's better to explore either of these libraries so\\nthat you will be able to extend yourself for a next one and this is something that we have mentioned plus a little bit\\nof deep neural network rna lstm cnn this is the variance just an overview about\\nagain i'm not saying that you are supposed to explore something in very very depth no if you're just aware about\\nit if you are just able to talk about it it's more than enough if you know something in depth if you if you have\\nthat kind of interest please go ahead no one is going to stop you right but\\nif you think that okay fine so this is like a too much for me and maybe uh\\nlike i will not be able to give this much of time it's completely fine you can stop yourself over here and then you\\ncan start working on your profile and resume a building and as we have given you\\na service right that you can come for a resume discussion so you can start\\nraising a request at this point of a time that okay i'm done with my study i'm done with my project right now i'm\\nable to deploy it i have done couple of the things now tell me how to build the resume you can come for a resume\\ndiscussions and we'll be happy to have you in our resume discussion one to one session at this point of a time and that\\nis our guidelines from i neuron now if i'll talk about a machine learning ops so yes tensorflow extend queue flow\\namazon sagemaker these are nothing but it's a ops so operational site and a\\nlittle bit of these things is required so let's suppose if i'm trying to build a product so without these things i will\\nnot be able to build a product i will not be able to host it on some server again so\\ndocker kubernetes teraforms ci cd github action jenkins all these things are\\nrequired now if i'll talk about a cloud right if i'll talk about a cloud so you're not supposed to explore each and\\nevery services which is available inside a cloud alone in aws itself there are more than more than 270 plus services\\nwhich is available now if you will uh like a start exploring all of these 270\\nservices which is available which is provided by alone aws right it is going to take a huge amount of\\ntime person is not going to hire you as an aws expert or cloud expert person is going to hire you companies are going to\\nhire you for a junior data scientist role so you are supposed to be aware\\nabout a services which is required for your machine learning algorithm deployment and creating and building a\\ncomplete end-to-end system and that is my advice for all of you and these are\\nthe only thing that you are supposed to explore now i'll show you your data\\nscience master's curriculum so where we have covered each and everything in detail so here as i was talking about uh\\npython so yes python basic is there oops concept is there database is there pandas is there right numpy is there\\nmatplotlib is there plotly is there c-bond eda biff framework python project\\nwith deployment i was talking about a scrapper right so yes that projects are available over here i was talking about\\na basic of mathematics yes those mathematics are available over here like i said many of us try to focus just on a\\nmathematics see uh study or learning is a never-ending process we will keep on\\nlearning but our first priority is to get into a job if i'll just think that\\nthat okay i'll get a mastery and then i will get into a job i think you will end up losing so much\\nof time so it's better to get into a job it's better to always focus on a things\\nwhich is going to give you a quick result right okay so here machine learning so again\\nall these algorithms has been discussed if i'll talk about a machine learning project there are so many machine learning pipeline based project which is\\navailable if i'll talk about a basic of deep learning so yes all of these things are already covered so whatever is\\nrequired every and everything is available inside your dashboard itself now if i'll talk about your raising a\\ndemand option so here you can raise a demand for a resume discussion so once you think that that okay i'm now i'm\\ngood so maybe i can i can go for a resume preparation and i should start applying for the job now if i'll talk\\nabout a mock interview right so yes uh you can come for a mock\\ninterview with us and we are going to do an assessment and we are going to tell you that okay so this is where you stand\\nas of now and maybe in this area or that area you are supposed to practice a lot\\ncoming back to this section so again to complete this section how much time is required on an average right so on an\\naverage how much time is required for a pressure to do a preparation like i said technology is not tough\\nand again some people say that yes it is tough but yeah it's just a matter of time i would say\\nso here a time which is required to do this preparation is max to max a four\\nmonth right max to max four month if religiously you are involving yourself\\nif on a daily basis you are trying to do a preparation for two hour to three hour not more than two to three hour so two\\nhour to three hour for four months right so you can try to keep a\\ntime for six months i would say six months so four month just go for the\\npreparation just try to do a preparation for four months right a complete hardcore preparation you can try to do\\nfor a four month and then for next two months just go for a revision plus\\nresume tuning plus just a project building and just a mock interview that\\nis and that should be the strategy and this is how you will be able to get it in a easiest possible way\\nright that should be your strategy at any point of a time two to three hour for four months regularly and then next\\ntwo months just on revision because multiple things many things i would say or maybe\\neverything that you will be able to find out over here is going to be new for you we completely agree right and as a human\\nbeing so it's a nature that we will not be able to retain each and everything and we will not be able to like uh tell\\neach and everything and everything will not be on your fingertips right so it's better it's better to do a revision for\\ntwo months parallel to this you can try to work on your resume parallel to this you can come for a mock interview and in\\nthis way it is going to help you out a lot so sixth month is maximum timing for\\ndoing this kind of a preparation for a fresher more than this is not required\\nand each and everything is there inside your data science master's curriculum which i have shown you inside your tech\\nneuron dashboard that's it and any kind of a help that you need in between let's\\nsuppose if you have a doubt or something you can raise a request over there and from our side so we are going to resolve\\nall of those doubt for all of you so with this uh thank you so much so hope you will try to spend at least a four\\nmonth of time plus two months for a revision and your final job preparation\\nas a pressure and hopefully it is going to help you out a lot and just let me know about\\nyour feedback if i have to add something over here or if you would like to discuss something over here so based on\\nyour feedback so i can try to modify and then uh maybe i'll come up with the latest version of it with that thank you\\nso much\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': 'Raw Data File_6.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id':

this session i'm going\\nto talk about how to do a data science\\npreparation uh for a people who is\\nhaving experience more than two year or\\nin between two to five years\\nso\\ni've just like uh released a previous\\nvideo in which i was talking about\\nroadmap for a pressure so now this is\\ngoing to be an extension of the same\\nthing so here when i'll talk about a\\nsenior data scientist because when you\\nhave an experience in between two to\\nfive year\\nthere is a very high chance that\\nposition wise they are going to offer\\nyou a position as a senior data\\nscientist now what in all things are\\nrequired so again computer science basic\\nis required that is very very important\\nprogramming as i have mentioned in my\\nprevious lecture\\nthat\\nprogramming wise\\nat least one single language is required\\nand my preferred language will be python\\nbecause\\nif i know one single language for sure i\\nwill be able to explore other languages\\nas well in the easiest possible way so\\ndon't try to focus on a multiple\\nprogramming languages python itself is a\\nvery very powerful language try to focus\\nalways on a python programming\\nand\\nyes so\\ndata structure algorithm now many people\\nask me a question that whether data\\nstitch algorithm is required or it's not\\nrequired\\nlet me tell you one thing very very\\nclearly over here\\nif you are going to start your career\\nwith a product-based companies\\nso yes it is required even as a fresher\\nit is required even if you are getting\\ninto a data science profile it is\\nrequired a basic of data stretch\\nalgorithm linked list queue tree tree\\ntraversal uh like a red factory like a\\nbinary tree all those things are\\nrequired\\nnow if you are going to apply for maybe\\na\\nservice based companies or some sort of\\na startup in that case data switch\\nalgorithm is not required so again make\\nsure of it it depends upon your\\nrequirements so you can try to adopt\\ndata algorithm or maybe you can try to\\ngo ahead with the simple programming\\nagain programming is very very important\\nside object-oriented programming modular\\ncoding again inside a python multiple\\nlibraries all those things are required\\nfor a data processing as i have already\\ndiscussed in my\\nprevious section of this video\\nnow if i'll talk about a programming\\ntechnique so here you are supposed to be\\naware about a design pattern so how we\\ncan try to design an entire solution for\\na particular problem that is something\\nwhich is very very important now if i'll\\ntalk about a test driven deployment\\nagain it is important so how you are\\ngoing to move your product or your\\nimplementation from a development system\\nto a testing environment or to a\\nproduction environment dependency\\ninjection so what in all dependencies\\nthat you are going to face may be\\nimprovised maybe a software device may\\nbe solution code wise so yes that is\\nrequired functional programming is very\\nvery important because without this no\\none is going to accept your code in a\\nproduction environment and then database\\nfundamentals are very very important\\nbecause\\nat the end of the day you are not going\\nto keep your data set inside your local\\nsystem your data must be available in\\nsome sql server in some file system or\\nmaybe in some nosql system and hence\\nthis database is required so you can\\nmaybe try to explore a sql and then you\\ncan try to explore one from nosql which\\nis a mongodb easy to implement easy to\\nunderstand and easy to consume these\\nthings inside your code again i have\\nmentioned a multiple nosql db again\\nthere is a huge list of sql and a nosql\\ndb each and everything is not required\\nat any point of a time if you are good\\nwith one i think you will be able to\\ncrack an interview in the easiest\\npossible way so please make sure of it\\nand programming design pattern as well\\nas database these things are very very\\nimportant and please make sure that you\\nhave and complete understanding about\\nthese things when you are going to apply\\nfor the job now coming to the next\\nsection mathematics\\nagain so don't try to like uh get a phd\\ninto it so yes math is required but till\\ncertain extent so not\\nlike everything is required inside a\\nmathematics whether it's a linear\\nalgebra whether it's a calculus whether\\nit's a probability whether it's a\\nstatistics so a couple of things is\\nrequired and more important thing is how\\nto do an implementation right how i will\\nbe able to use a particular things let's\\nsuppose if i'm talking about a jet test\\nif i'm talking about a p value if i'm\\ntalking about a b testing implementation\\nwise how i can utilize all of these\\nconcept and all of these knowledges in\\nmy development so this is how you are\\nsupposed to understand a mathematics not\\njust in terms of a mathematical way\\nright uh just by solving some sort of a\\nsimple problem no this time so you are\\nsupposed to understand this methodics in\\na way that you will be able to solve\\nsome of the data related problem and\\nthen you can start joining a data\\nscience community because again\\ncommunity is very very important here\\nyou will be able to see a perspective of\\nour mindset of a different people and an\\nexpectation of our companies and many\\nmore things you will be able to learn\\nand these things is going to help you\\nout even to get a job right so start\\nbuilding your com community but always\\nin a constructive direction not in a\\nnegative direction so when i say\\ncommunity i think we are supposed to uh\\nget an advantage of it maybe in a\\npositive way\\nnow coming to our next section so here\\ndata analysis again it's important it's\\nrequired right data analysis like a\\nfeature engineering data wrangling edas\\nand then you can start writing an\\narticle and then bib scrapping so like i\\nsaid in my previous section that some\\ntime so you will not be able to get all\\nthe data from your client and this is\\nwhere\\nscrapping is required sometime there\\nwill be a data dependency there is some\\nsort of a derived data you have to\\ncreate now at that point of a time\\nscrapping helps us a lot to prepare\\nthose kind of a data now you are\\nsupposed to justify that how i will be\\nable to use and scrapping if you are\\ngoing to mention a scrapping project\\ninside your resume but yes\\nthat is something that you are supposed\\nto understand now uh like coming to the\\nnext section so indexation so machine\\nlearning is important\\nobviously you are trying to prepare\\nyourself for a data science so\\nhow you can leave a machine learning\\nwithout machine learning so you can't\\nbecome a data scientist that is like a\\nabcd of data science so yes machine\\nlearning is required 10 algorithms i\\nbelieve not 100 but a way by which you\\nwill be able to productionize those 10\\nalgorithm you will be able to build on a\\nscalable system you will be able to do\\neverything that you want so in that way\\nyou are supposed to learn a machine\\nlearning algorithm\\nkeep always these things in our mind\\nknowing just a theoretical concept or\\nmaybe just a mathematical concept for a\\nmachine learning algorithms are not\\nsufficient nowadays it's not relevant in\\na current industry scenario because\\nlet's try to assume uh one one case over\\nhere so let's suppose there is a company\\nxyz and uh who is trying to hire you for\\ntheir like a senior data scientist\\nposition or this particular role\\nand you're just aware about a\\ntheoretical concept a mathematic concept\\nthose companies will not be able to\\ndeploy you they will not be able to\\nassign you any kind of a job any kind of\\na portfolio because you have never\\nworked into a deployment you have never\\nworked into a scalability you have never\\nwalked into a model retraining you're\\nnot aware about it right\\nand that is something which is required\\nyou have never you have never worked in\\na pipelining\\nof any kind of a production grid\\nsolution which is a requirement which is\\na requirement of a particular project so\\nwhy they are going to hire you\\njust for a reason that you know some\\nsort of a machine learning algorithm\\nin a theoretical way they are not going to hire you they are going to reject\\nyour profile they are going to reject\\nyour resume so it's always better\\nto learn all of these algorithm till\\ndeployment how i will be able to\\nproductionize these things how in a real\\nsense i will be able to use it and this\\nis how each and every algorithm whether\\nit's a machine learning or machine\\nlearning advanced algorithm so this is\\nhow in that way you are supposed to\\nlearn and then you can start reading a\\nresearch paper if you have an interest\\nbecause sometime in an interview so they\\ntry to ask you a question saying that\\nthat\\nwhat is the source of your knowledge\\nright so maybe you can give an argument\\nover there that okay fine so i keep on\\nreading a research paper i keep on\\nexploring multiple things by my side and\\nthis is how i just keep on like uh\\nupdating myself on a regular basis right\\nso this is where research paper comes\\ninto a picture now\\nproduct wise yes it is very very\\nimportant there are so many projects\\nthat we have given to you in your data\\nscience master's curriculum\\nnow\\nsomewhere\\ndata visualization is also important so\\nnot all maybe just a w maybe just a\\npower bi maybe just a looker maybe just\\na click view so at least one\\nyou must be having a basic idea and\\nunderstanding about this w power bi\\nlookup click view any of these things\\ni'm not telling you i'm not asking you\\nthat to get a mastery into each and\\neverything either of these is completely\\nfine to mention those things inside your\\nresume and that is going to increase our\\nweightage saying that that yes i'm a\\nperson who knows how to build how to\\ndeploy how to productionize a machine\\nlearning algorithm i know how to play\\nwith the data i know even a statistical\\nconcept so if you are going to give me\\nsome new challenges for sure i will be\\nable to solve it apart from that\\ni will be able to create a complete\\ndashboard right so where manager will be\\nable to see a stats they will be able to\\nvisualize each and everything they will\\nbe able to see a report and for a\\nreporting site these things as important\\nnow so as a senior data scientist yes\\nthere will be an expectations on a deep\\nlearning side you are supposed to\\navailable you can't say that no i don't\\nknow deep learning i just know machine\\nlearning i have already worked into a\\nmachine learning and i'm just looking\\nfor a machine learning profile because\\nnowadays almost every companies are\\ntrying to explore trying to build a\\nsolution by using this deep learning\\nwhich is again very very important and\\nyou are supposed to learn a deep\\nlearning concept this is important so\\nplease try to make sure that deep\\nlearning concept try to explore there\\nare a multiple vision algorithm you will\\nbe able to find out nlp based algorithm\\nyou will be able to find out or basic of\\ndeep learning basic of a and that's more\\nthan enough but yes please try to\\nexplore those things and then you can\\nstart building your resume this is\\nsomething that you should do\\nnow computer vision so yes a little bit\\nlike i have mentioned nlp a little bit\\nwhatever algorithm that we have\\nmentioned over there so you are supposed\\nto aware about it\\nbig data\\nso you are going to work as a senior\\ndata scientist and let's suppose if i\\nhave to ask you i have to assign you a\\ntask for a pipelining\\nthis is where this big data comes into a\\npicture a basic of big data is very very\\nimportant at least you must be aware\\nabout a component like a pig hive kafka\\nspark airflow nifi all those solutions\\nand why we are going to use the solution\\nso that in an interview if someone is\\ngoing to ask you a question that are you\\naware about this take a stack you can\\nsay yes i'm aware about it and maybe uh\\nlike uh\\ni can work if this task will be assigned\\nto me so yes that is important and\\nplease make sure that you must be having\\nsome sort of idea and we have already\\ngiven you a lecture inside your data\\nscience master's curriculum now if i'll\\ntalk about uh cloud computing again\\ncloud computing is required because at\\nthe end of the day everything you are\\ngoing to host inside a cloud it can be a\\naws azure it can be a gcp it can be some\\nother cloud but yes it is going to be a\\ncloud in majority of an environment in\\nmissouri of a companies so cloud\\ncomputing is important to build into a\\nsolution because you are going to work\\nas a\\nsenior data scientist and without this\\nhow you will be able to productionize a\\nsolution into it you will be able to\\nbuild a solution plus machine learning\\noperation or ai ops we used to say or ml\\nops we used to say somewhere so these\\nthings are very very important we are\\nsupposed to aware about an ops part so\\nthat i will be able to use a docker\\nkubernetes or jenkins or maybe i will be\\nable to use our tfx and many more things\\nright\\nso please make sure that try to explore\\nuh ai offside or maybe a mlob side which\\nwill give you a complete system design\\nperspective for any kind of ai system\\nthat we are going to build and this is\\nsomething that we have mentioned over\\nthere so like a model retraining\\nvalidations deployment scheduling\\neverything comes under the op section\\nagain inside the op section so docker\\nkubernetes teraform jenkins all those\\nthings comes into picture and cloud\\nservices so\\nthese this is the roadmap for a senior\\ndata scientist which is an extension of\\na junior data scientist itself not\\ntalking about a time so if i'll talk\\nabout a time how much time you are\\nsupposed to spend so far sure if you are\\ngoing to apply for a senior data\\nscientist position so in that sense you\\nare supposed to spend at least three\\nhour two four hour\\non an average on a daily basis for five\\nto six months\\nand apart from this so maybe you can try\\nto keep a buffer period of one to two\\nmonths\\nfor your projects right for your resume\\ndiscussion for your mock interview for\\nyour detailed project report creation\\nand a fine tuning of yourself you can\\ntry to keep a buffer of like one to two\\nmonths so in seven to eight months it is\\npossible if you are if as an average\\nperson so if you are trying to spend\\nthis quality hours three to four quality\\nhours i'm telling you i'm not saying\\nthat you're just sitting on a chair for\\nthree to four hour for five to six\\nmonths and then it's it can happen no\\nthe quality hour is very very important\\nif you are going to spend this much of\\ntime it's easy to get a job as a senior\\ndata scientist plus focus more and more\\non project side and if you are applying\\nfor a product based company focus on dsa\\nas well\\ndata structure algorithm which is again\\nmentioned inside your tech neuron each\\nand everything which i'm talking about\\nis already available inside your data\\nscience master's curriculum and you can\\ntry to explore each and everything from\\nthis tech neuron itself nothing will go\\nbeyond it\\nplus\\neven interview questions we are like uh\\nwe have already uploaded inside a 30\\ndays interview question series plus\\nthere is a github profile of i neuron\\ngithub like a link of iron where you\\nwill be able to find out interview\\nquestions and believe me no one is going\\nto surpass that particular label so you\\ncan try to plan yourself accordingly and\\nthen you can try to crack\\nthis one and these things can these\\nthings is possible so again i'm\\nconsidering a fact that we have started\\nfrom\\nzero right i'm not saying that you have\\nsome sort of experience and then this is\\ngoing to work for you no i'm talking\\nabout just a ground zero from where we\\nhave started and then if i'm going to\\nstart my preparation with this one\\ncalled as data science masters and\\neverything everything and\\nwhatever whatever i have discussed\\neverything you will be able to find out\\ninside this section itself there is a\\n1100 plus video which we have uploaded\\nso it's a huge curriculum that we have\\ndesigned\\njust say machine learning deep learning\\naiofs big data data analytics everything\\nprojects and everything will be\\navailable over it's already available\\nover here so please try to explore\\naccording to your requirements and if\\nyou are doing a preparation so from\\ntoday onwards you can start a\\npreparation create a chart create a\\ntable saying that okay fine so i'll try\\nto invest three to four hour of time for\\nnext five to six months and then last\\none to two months i will try to expand\\non a revision side on a mock interview\\nside on a resumer side and on a project\\nside because\\nlearning is completely fine but learning\\nis not going to give you a believe me\\nyour experience your expertise and a\\ncapability to build a solution is going\\nto give you a job the kind of packages\\nthat you're looking for the kind of a\\nprofile that you are looking for each\\nand everything will come out of your exp\\nnot out of your learning if you know\\nhundreds of machine learning algorithm\\nbut you don't know how to productionize\\neven a single one believe me\\none is going to help you\\nright so always try to focus on a real\\nthing\\njust try to maintain a habit\\nof like uh sitting on on a chair for\\nthree to four hour\\nand that is something which can change\\nagain\\nright so that is my advice to all of you\\nguys and hope you will do as it is as i\\nhave discussed and keep on writing your\\ncomments uh so if you have any kind of a\\ndoubt any kind of a concern so for sure\\ni will be happy to clarify those things\\nwith that thank you so much\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': 'Raw Data File_6.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd38a8ffd43f3e5d5becd0e74e2b66e2e'}>, <Document: {'content': \"Data Science Roadmap 5-8 Year Experienced | One Neuron\\nURL- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guwOATf9U-A\\nTIMELAPSE-\\nhello everyone so welcome to oneiron and\\ntoday i'm going to talk about how to do\\na preparation so if i have an experience\\nindustry experience again i'm talking\\nabout so if i have an industry\\nexperience of in between maybe uh five\\nto eight years so in that case how i\\nwill be able to do a preparation so here\\nuh like uh yes computer science\\nfundamentals or maybe i will say like\\noperating system fundamentals is very\\nvery important so i believe i'm supposed\\nto be aware about uh basic of linux\\ncommand that is pretty much obvious what\\nis uh uses of terminal or what is a rest\\napi\\nor what in all different different\\nframeworks which is available to create\\napis plus a programming language again\\nprogramming language wise i will not\\nadvise you to go after a multiple\\nprogramming language i think one is more\\nthan enough\\nand the best one is python so it's a\\nvery very powerful language and easy to\\nlearn as i have mentioned in my\\nlike a roadmap of afresha in a very\\ndetail again inside a python programming\\nmodular coding is important object\\noriented programming is important a\\ncouple of libraries are very very\\nimportant like a numpy pandas\\nmatplotlib seaborn\\ncuff links all those things very very\\nimportant plus programming technique you\\nare supposed to know a design pattern\\nhow to create a test environment uh\\ndeployment dependencies and all those\\nthings right so programming technique\\nwise because you\\nwill be given a task to deploy to\\nproductionize and to build a complete\\nsystem\\nuh there is a chances that if you are\\ngoing to join an organization as a lead\\nin that case you will be able to get\\nyour team now you have to drive that\\nentire team so you should know all the\\nstandard procedures and protocols\\nfor example uh model coding right so\\nlogging monitoring debugging right\\neverything must be like there you are\\nsupposed to know about it you must be\\nlike a\\nlike a doing all of those things inside\\nyour project apart from that the\\nknowledge of databases because yes\\nwithout databases you will not be able\\nto build anything in like anywhere right\\nso knowledge of sql system and nosql\\nsystem is very very important if it is\\nrequired so try to learn a multiple\\nsequels and a nosql system again\\nafter some time you will be able to find\\nout that everything is same and it's\\nlike if i can do if i can work in one\\nthing i will be able to work in other\\nthing so just try to learn in that way\\nand just try to build your perspective\\nin this particular fashion that would be\\nmore than\\nnow coming to a mathematical side so yes\\nuh sometimes so you are going to face\\nyour client directly\\nsometimes so you will be taking a\\nbusiness requirements right uh business\\nis going to in fact with you on a\\nregular basis they are going to assign\\nyou a task they are going to check a\\nfeasibility\\nof a particular task with you so yes you\\nmust be aware about all the statistical\\nconcept uh which has been used to\\nevaluate a project to evaluate a data\\nset plus a multiple mathematical expects\\nfrom a linear algebra from a statistics\\nfrom a calculus and from everywhere\\nso that you will be able to utilize\\nthese things right you all will be able\\nto realize these things while evaluating\\na data while doing an assessment for a\\nparticular project for a particular\\nclient so you are supposed to know about\\na mathematics in a pure\\nlike a in a way you know in a way by\\nwhich you will be able to use all of\\nthese things in a real time that is this\\nis how you should learn a mathematics\\nlet's suppose i'm just talking about uh\\na b testing or if i'm talking about a\\nhypothesis testing if i'm talking about\\na probability right\\nso it's not like if you are able to\\nsolve a couple of problem in a\\nprobability your work is done no how to\\nuse these probabilities in a machine\\nlearning in a deep learning in a\\ncomputer vision inside a nlp this is how\\nyou are supposed to know about it this\\nis how you are supposed to adopt a\\nmathematics at this point of a time not\\nin a mathematical way but in a way\\nby which you will be able to explore\\nsomething out of the data something out\\nof the requirement given by your client\\nor maybe your team member so this is how\\nyou should learn a mathematics always go\\nin a practical way when i'm saying\\npractical doesn't mean that how to\\nconvert one particular like uh\\nlike equation into a programming no that\\nis not a practical way i'm talking about\\ni'm just talking about a way by which\\nyou can really implement it and then you\\nwill be able to\\nlike uh get some sort of insights out of\\nit that is a way by which you should\\nlearn mathematics and then you can start\\nbuilding your own data science community\\ni think that would be better you can\\nstart guiding someone you can start\\nlike interacting with the people who are\\nalready a part of a data science\\ncommunity uh because you will be able to\\nsee a perspective from our different\\ndifferent people and a person so this is\\nhow you should\\nmove ahead now coming to a data analysis\\nsection so yes programming wise you are\\nsupposed to do a data analysis but\\nalways keep one thing in mind\\nalways try to find out a logical\\ndependencies or a logical relationship\\nbetween a different different attributes\\neven inside your data this is how you\\nare supposed to do a data analysis\\nalways try to focus on a business and\\nthen try to understand a nature of the\\ndata a particular business is trying to\\ngenerate which will help you out to\\nbuild a case in a strongest possible way\\nand you can present it in front of your\\nmanager or in front of your client right\\nin a strongest possible way because\\non this label\\nyou will be uh you will experience some\\ntime that uh it's not possible to build\\na ai solution for every problem right\\nit's not possible\\nor sometimes so it's better to go ahead\\nwith a non-ai solution as compared to a\\nai solution because of maybe uh ease of\\ncreating it or ease of like or maybe\\nbecause of a less number of dependencies\\nyou will be able to get so it's not like\\nevery time if someone is giving you a\\nproblem statement we are supposed to go\\nin a ai way ai is just a tip right\\nmaybe we can look for even a simple\\nsolution right so instead of like going\\nahead with the hard way so maybe we can\\ntry to choose an easy one that is\\npossible so you are always supposed to\\npresent your case and that case you will\\nbe able to present if you are good with\\nan analysis of a data plus if you\\nunderstand a business\\nthe kind of attribute that business has\\nassigned to you the kind of a columns\\nthe kind of values that business has\\ngiven to you so based on that you have\\nto do a data analysis again it's a\\nbroader one it's like a you have to\\nunderstand a broader picture over here\\nand based on that so you are supposed to\\nrepresent these things in front of your\\nclient and then you can start writing\\nyour own article based on your own\\nthesis based on your own analysis on a\\ndaily basis that's completely fine which\\nwill build a social profile for you\\nbecause on your label these things are\\nvery very very very important right so\\nyou can start writing an article baby\\nscrapping and all those things it's just\\na part of it part of your job\\nso for sure you have to know anyhow\\nright now if i'll talk about machine\\nlearning algorithms so yes you are\\nsupposed to know about machine learning\\nalgorithm at least 10 to 20 algorithms\\nfrom a supervised machine learning from\\nunsupervised machine learning from a\\nsemi supervised machine learning site or\\nmaybe from a design machine inside so\\nyou are supposed to know about machine\\nlearning algorithm again if i'll talk\\nabout a sequence of algorithms so linear\\nregression and then like a polynomial\\nregression multi-linear regression risk\\nregression lasso regressions or maybe a\\ndecision tree regression with the help\\nof decision tree or maybe a support\\nvector regressions there are so many\\nalgorithms you will be able to find out\\nin a regulation site itself so yes you\\nare supposed to be aware about it now if\\ni'll talk about a classification\\nalgorithm so maybe a logistic relational\\nalgorithm support vector classifier\\nalgorithm decision tree or maybe uh xj\\nboost boost or maybe\\nlike a random forest so there are again\\na series of algorithm that you will be\\nable to find out now knowing an\\nalgorithm\\nand its mathematics and its theory is\\ngood\\nbut\\nit's not enough\\nit's not enough for a particular job if\\nyou are just working as a researcher\\nmaybe that is fine you can just keep on\\ndoing a research on a mathematical side\\non a stat side and it is completely fine\\nbut as a person who has joined a giant\\njoined an organization and who is having\\na task to deliver it\\nover here\\nso you are supposed to learn an\\nalgorithm plus its implementation now\\nwhen i'm talking about implementation it\\ndoesn't mean that that i'm just talking\\nabout like a calling in garth passing a\\ndata inside it like fitting up the data\\ninside the algorithm and then work is\\ndone no\\nthis is again not a way\\nright most of us have done that right\\nmost of us have like a created a model\\nbut it's of no use believe me\\nunless and until you are not going to\\ncreate a complete pipeline from your\\nextract transform and load plus building\\nan algorithm plus productionizing it\\nfirst of all into a development\\nenvironment then uat then into a\\nproduction unless and until you are not\\ngoing to build a complete pipeline for a\\nmodel retraining you are not going to\\ndefine a model retraining approach right\\nyou are not going to build a system\\nwhich can work for one and which can\\nwork for million right\\ni think your work is not done so you\\nhave to focus you have to have focus\\nmore and more on a system side\\non a architecture side on a design side\\nas well you will be the one who is going\\nto decide that or you are going to\\nadvise to your senior management saying\\nthat that this is the architecture this\\nis the databases which i have used\\nwhether it's a sequel or nosql\\nthis is the cloud infra which i have\\ntaken this is the services which i am\\nconsuming this is the derived data set\\nwhich i have created\\nright so complete detail project report\\nyou have to create by yourself and for\\nthat you have to learn all of those\\nthings you have to experiment and\\nexplore all of those things on this\\nlabel right and that is the reason so i\\nhave given you an advice that just\\nknowing a machine learning algorithm or\\nits mathematical term or theoretical\\nterm is not enough at all right so just\\ntry to explore these things beyond it\\nand everything is given to you in your\\ndata science master's curriculum for you\\nguys or you guys who falls in between\\nthis particular bracket\\nso the since your advice to all of you\\nis that focus more and more on\\nimplementation side instead of\\ntheoretical side\\nthat will give you experience and that\\nis something which is going to work in\\nyour interview if you are not focusing\\non your practical side things will go\\nsouth believe me things will go south if\\nyou think that that i just know about an\\nalgorithm and mathematical term i'm good\\nwith it and it is going to work no\\nalways and always people will try to\\nfocus on an implementation side and\\nagain a core end-to-end implementation\\ntill deployment till retraining approach\\nso just keep always these things in our\\nmind and then if you want you can start\\nreading a research paper if you want you\\ncan start exploring a different\\ndifferent kind of systems as well\\nnow coming to a data visualization even\\nif you have not worked into a data\\nvisualization but still you must be\\naware about a connectivity you must be\\naware about a basic of it right whether\\nit's a w or power bi or looker or click\\nview or any other dashboarding tool but\\nyes you are supposed to be aware about\\nit now if i'm talking about a deep\\nlearning\\ndeep learning is must for you guys\\ndeep learning a basic is at least\\nimportant if even if you are going to\\nswitch as a machine learning engineer\\npeople must be having an expectation\\nthat you are aware about a little bit of\\ndeep learning so please keep these\\nthings in mind that you have an idea\\nabout a deep learning and with the\\npreparation you should go right okay now\\ncoming to a computer vision so computer\\nvision again it's an ocean so you can\\nexplore the entire syllabus that we have\\ngiven to you with the\\nuse implementation almost every kind of\\nimplementation is mentioned inside your\\ncomputer vision which is a part of your\\ndata science master's curriculum if i'll\\ntalk about nlp yes everything is\\nmentioned if i'll talk about a big data\\nyes everything is mentioned why we have\\nmentioned all of these components there\\nis a reason behind this the reason is\\nthat\\nat the end of the day system is the only\\nthing which matters and you are going to\\nbuild a system\\nright so unless and until you are not\\nhaving an idea and understanding about\\nthe whole system and its integration how\\nyou will be able to build a system and\\nkeeping these things in your mind we\\nhave given you this entire huge\\ncurriculum yes it takes time but\\nit's going to pay you a lot\\nso it's better to go ahead with a\\npreparation in a war so that you will be\\nable to\\nwin it right so go for\\nwin here cloud computing infrastructure\\nmachine learning ops site again for you\\nguys it's very very important ci cd all\\nthose things are important\\nnow for\\nespecially for a person who is going to\\nwork as a lead i will try to focus on\\nthis side\\nyou will be engaged or you will be a\\npart of engaging a stakeholder your\\nclient or a person who is going to\\nassign you a work right so you will be\\nresponsible for deriving uh values\\nright identifying their need so maybe\\nyou can propose them that okay fine so\\nmaybe i can solve this problem in this\\nway maybe you can\\nbring a business for your uh like a\\nrespective organizations right so even\\nyou as a lead will be responsible for\\nexploring a new things creating a values\\ninside your company because your next\\nrole is going to be a managerial role or\\nmaybe\\nwhen whenever you will join a next\\ncompany so yes you are must be prepared\\nfor these roles right so how in a best\\npossible way you can engage your\\nstakeholder how in a best possible way\\nyou are going to introduce a new\\ncapacity inside your team infuse on new\\nthings inside your team how you are\\ndoing a pocs rfps how you are going to\\nbuild an entire team how you are going\\nto reskill your entire team along with\\nyourself matters a lot on this\\nparticular label so my sincere advice to\\nall of you will be to focus even on\\nthese side right generally as a techie\\nso\\nwe never try to focus on this side but\\nbelieve me if you are going to focus on\\nthis side it is going to change your\\nlife and it is going to right and it is\\ngoing to give you an open up\\nhell lot of opportunity in a market\\nright so please make sure that you do it\\nright you take a stick holding take a\\nownership take a leadership and deliver\\nit\\ntry to build a team build our\\ncapabilities right so let's suppose you\\nhave joined a team and over there so\\nthey're just working on machine learning\\ntry to set up a team who can even work\\ninto a deep learning even work into a\\ncomputer vision even work into a\\nreinforcement learning\\ntry to build a capability so that you\\nwill be able to do a integration of your\\nexisting system with any other system\\nand you will be able to do a maybe like\\na\\ndie to achieve a cost cutting try to\\nachieve a reskilling of the team and\\nthere are so many activities that we can\\ndo on a floor right on a daily basis so\\nalways try to work as a team leader over\\nthere\\nand\\njust try to build an awesome team over\\nthere okay\\nso educate educate your team right and\\nagain help assist each and everything\\nso that is a very very important and\\nthis is something which i have mentioned\\nso build a complete data science culture\\ntry to understand requirements of each\\nand every clients try to extract as much\\nbusiness as possible and that is\\nsomething which is going to give you a\\nsuccess now coming to now coming to our\\ndashboard so here inside this dashboard\\neach and everything we have given to you\\nright everything right from the\\nbeginning so whatever is required to\\nexplore to discuss to like uh experiment\\nright everything is available over here\\nyou are not supposed to go anywhere and\\nif something is missing yes you can\\nconnect with us and then we will try to\\nhelp you out but\\ntry to explore this data science masters\\nin detail just try to spend as much time\\nas possible now time wise if i'll say so\\ntime wise so maybe you can try to spend\\nso time wise you can try to spend maybe\\nright three to four hour which is\\naverage i think that's more than enough\\nso\\nthree to four\\nhours right maybe for six to seven\\nmonths and one to two months\\nyou can try to take for a revision uh\\nfor a resume preparation for your mock\\ninterview for a project for a detailed\\nproject report dpr and all those things\\nright so always always try to like a\\nwork as per the given instruction and\\neasy to make a transition again you can\\ncome for the resume discussions you can\\ncome for the mock interview with iron\\nteam so there is a razor demand option\\nwhich is given to you and just try to\\nutilize just try to take advantage of it\\nas much as possible\\nso hope this is going to help you out a\\nlot with this thank you so much and see\\nyou\\nsee all of you in my next lecture thank\\nyou\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': 'Raw Data File_6.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '1bf2ec0ceed9d3e0d3859d3a8c1adbd5'}>, <Document: {'content': \"hello everyone welcome to oneiron and in\\nthis session i'm going to talk about uh\\nroadmap a data science roadmap for a\\nsenior people or a data scientist for a\\npeople who is having experience more\\nthan eight years so in this session i'm\\nnot going to follow a top-down approach\\ni'm going to follow a bottom-up approach\\nand there is a specific reason behind\\nthis approach which i am going to follow\\nto explain a road map for this data\\nscience for a senior people now just try\\nto understand in this way\\nthat if i'm a senior a person if i'm\\nworking as a manager or maybe if i'm\\nworking as a lead or architect in that\\ncase\\nright what will be my roles and\\nresponsibility my roles and\\nresponsibility will be to talk to a\\nstakeholder first of all\\nit is also a possibility that you will\\nbe a stakeholder in your respective\\norganization means you will be\\nresponsible for explaining you will be\\nresponsible for deriving a new business\\nopportunities for your organization and\\nin that case you have to interact with a\\nlot of people on a daily basis apart\\nfrom this so let's suppose if you are\\nworking on a technical side so for sure\\nyou are the one who will be responsible\\nfor designing the architecture system\\nrelease whatever you can say end-to-end\\nfor every application so here top-down\\napproach is not going to work if you are\\ngoing to start learning a python then if\\nyou will try to start like uh learning\\nmachine learning then deep learning i\\nthink that is not going to work and this\\nis not the approach that you all are\\nsupposed to follow so first of all try\\nto understand that what kind of a role\\nand responsibility you are going to play\\nwhen you are going to join your next\\norganization so for sure as a lead as a\\nmanager as a director as architect so\\nyou all are going to like build a team\\nso yes for a organization for a current\\norganization so maybe i'm going to join\\none company and\\nmanager of like or maybe our directors\\nare going to ask me to build a team\\nmaybe a company is trying to build a new\\ncapabilities for a machine learning for\\na deep learning for a computer vision\\nfor a hardware ai based research or\\nmaybe for a reinforcement learning so\\nyes that will be my responsibilities\\nfinding out a right person for your team\\nwill be an important task for you and\\nyou have to build a team let's suppose\\nif you have a existing team so in that\\ncase you have to think about a race\\nkilling your existing team because\\ntechnologies are changing on a daily\\nbasis again on a daily basis you will be\\nable to find out a new algorithm new\\nimplementation a new tech stack so again\\nthat will come on you for your company\\nso you have to bring a client because\\nunless and until you are not going to\\nbring a client inside your current\\norganization i believe your roles are\\nnot going to be a relevant one so again\\nyou have to work on a client acquisition\\nas well you have to bring a business\\nplus whatever business that you are or\\nwhatever the stakeholding that you have\\nas of now so you have to deliver those\\nthings on a daily basis maybe on a\\nweekly or monthly basis at a time so you\\nare not going to handle just a single\\nteam so at a time there is a chance that\\nyou will end up handling a multiple team\\nagain multiple team for a data science\\nor multiple team which is from a data\\nscience or maybe apart from data science\\nfor example so let's suppose if i'm\\ntrying to build a machine learning\\nsolution so if i'm trying to build a\\nmachine learning solution so it's not\\nlike a solution you will be able to\\nbuild just by having a capability of a\\nmachine learning engineer no big data\\nengineer is required someone is required\\nin on a dashboarding site someone is\\nrequired maybe on a website someone is\\nrequired on a platform site someone is\\nrequired on our off site someone is\\nrequired on an infrasight so there are\\nmultiple teams that you need and you\\nwill have to handle an entire team at a\\nat a time you have to build a flow you\\nhave to build a process and a pipeline\\nso that you will be able to deliver\\nsomething so you're not supposed to work\\njust on one single thing plus you have\\nto derive a new solution on a regular\\nbasis because that is a need that is the\\nneed of our industry this is how market\\nis going to work and so\\nbottom up approach you are supposed to\\nfollow so first of all you are supposed\\nto know let's suppose i'm trying to get\\ninto a healthcare domain or maybe into a\\nsupply chain domain so i'm supposed to\\nlike uh know first of all in a very\\nfirst phase that\\nwhat kind of a solution is possible in\\nai at least some because there are\\nmillions of there are infinite number of\\nsolution you will be able to find out in\\nor out of the organization but in a\\nbeginning itself you are supposed to\\nknow about it because people is going to\\nask you a question you know interview\\nthat how many projects you have\\ndelivered what is the kind of a business\\nthat you have bring inside the company\\nwhat is the total profit what is uh like\\na number of clients that you have\\nhandled so far so forth how many number\\nof people you have handled so far so\\nforth and what is a diversification of\\nthat particular team so these are the\\nquestion when comes in a first phase so\\nwhy we are not supposed to start from\\nthat particular area so if i have to\\napply for a job i'll start exploring\\nthese areas what is a solution now once\\ni will be able to understand that okay\\nso x y z kind of a solutions are\\npossible in this respective domain then\\ni will start exploring about a\\ntechnology and here if you can see\\nright so this is what i have mentioned\\nin this particular slide so i'm trying\\nto state over here that okay so let's\\nsuppose if i'm trying to like a build or\\nif i'm trying to do something so here\\narchitect role wise so i'm supposed to\\nfocus on architectural drivers so what\\nin all requirements what in all\\ntechnology from a different perspective\\ni'm supposed to learn then a technology\\nselection designing the entire solution\\nthen evaluation of the entire\\narchitecture quality assurance coaching\\nand mentorship again this is going to be\\nyour part so i'm supposed to focus on\\nall of these things building a right\\nteam with a right people right number of\\npeople in a like a timeline that is\\ngiven to you again that is a crucial\\ntask that we all used to play on a\\nsenior label\\nand you have to design a process process\\nfor a delivery process for reskilling\\nprocess for handling a team process for\\ngenerating a new business so everywhere\\nyou will be involved now the best part\\nor the best way to explore these things\\nis with the help of this particular\\ncourse which is available over here\\ncalled as dsar data science architecture\\nand resume so this is a session which i\\nhave delivered last year it's a bit\\nlengthy session you will be able to find\\nout but again at the same point of time\\nit is going to be an interesting one i\\nhave received many feedback many comment\\nfrom a multiple people saying that yes\\nit is very very effective and it has\\nhelped me a lot so first of all try to\\nunderstand a design first of all try to\\nunderstand architecture now if i'm going\\nto talk about this part two you will be\\nuh able to understand that here i have\\ndiscussed about one of the problem and a\\ndesign and the solution which\\nwe have created when i was working for\\nxyz company right so here you will be\\nable to see a conceptual architecture as\\nwell as you will be able to understand a\\ntechnical architecture which i have\\ndiscussed in a very very detailed way\\nyou will be able to understand a\\nbusiness problem and its respective\\nsolution and that is the reason so i had\\ncreated this dsar architecture classes\\nright through ysa data science\\narchitecture and resume discussion\\nclasses i have given for a community\\nlast year so for you it's a very first\\nthe very first thing that you are\\nsupposed to explore is this one dsar so\\nplease try to start from here please try\\nto understand that what you are supposed\\nto do and what you are not supposed to\\ndo\\nthis is fine so forget about technology\\nforget about everything right because ai\\nis nothing but it's a set of technology\\nby which you can solve a problem in\\nevery domain\\nwithout any exception without any\\noutlier you can solve we all can solve\\nit so please try to go through this one\\nnow coming back to this one\\nright so now let's suppose if i'm aware\\nabout right if i'm aware about the\\nentire things what i can do what i can't\\nright if i'm aware about the\\narchitecture i'm aware about the\\nsolution designing i'm aware about the\\nclient business problem and my team\\nright so each and every process is set\\nthen maybe we are supposed to look into\\na tech side now in some company if you\\nare going to join as a manager maybe\\nthese things are not required but yes in\\nsome company so it is required\\nespecially in product based company so\\nyes you must be having a business\\nunderstanding the understanding which i\\nwas talking about apart from this so you\\nare supposed to be aware about a\\ntechnology so it would be better if you\\ncan start again with the bottom up\\napproach so try to learn try to talk\\nabout first of all infrastructure how i\\nwill be able to utilize those\\ninfrastructure for like a ml solution\\nfor a python solution for a vision\\nsolution for a s device solution and all\\nsort of things so in this way if you are\\ngoing to learn\\noffside infrasight because that is going\\nto give you a broader view\\nand that is important for a senior\\npeople unless and until you are not\\ngoing to understand a broader view a\\nhigh label design you will not be able\\nto implement a low level design at all\\nbecause you are the person who will be\\nresponsible for designing this solution\\nyou will be the person who is going to\\nmake it or break it everything over here\\nin an organization you will be the one\\nbased on\\nbased on whose instruction entire team\\nis going to work so if you are the one\\nwho is not aware about these things how\\nyour team is going to work how your team\\nis going to deliver that is not possible\\nand that is the reason so i have asked\\nyou that try to follow a bottom up\\napproach try to look into this one and\\nthen you are supposed to explore this ai\\nops course\\nwhich is available over here ai ops\\ncourse is very very important for all of\\nyou especially for architect especially\\nfor seniors so after dsar you are\\nsupposed to get into these things these\\nentire things so that right so that you\\nwill be able to understand a complete\\ninfrasight in a detail and a depth way\\nbecause coding is fine so more or less\\nuh amount of coding is completely fine\\nif you are aware about something uh like\\na coding or maybe you're not that that\\nis a secondary thing but infra\\narchitecture design business clients\\nthese are the things which you should\\nfocus on in a very very first place and\\nthis is something that you are going to\\nmention inside your resume then\\nif i'll talk about a specialization\\nright so let's suppose if i'm aware\\nabout the offside if i'm aware about\\neach and everything then\\nas an overview again you are not\\nsupposed to go in depth i'll not suggest\\nyou so you should know almost everything\\nbut not\\nmastery into each and everything yeah\\nwith a timeline for sure you will be\\nable to get a mastery but as you are\\ntrying to make a transition and if you\\nwill invest your time\\nlike most of the time just to cover up a\\nbeginning maybe a python maybe a stats\\nmaybe ml algorithm in that case you will\\nfeel like a frustrated because as a\\nsenior people so we have a different\\ndifferent responsibility uh family\\nresponsibility or maybe in office so we\\nhave so many different different kind of\\nresponsibilities and it is going to\\ncreate a pain so just to remove that\\nparticular pain try to understand first\\na design architecture solution whether\\nit's possible whether it's not so once\\nyou will start talking about or you will\\nbe in a position to talk about a 10\\ndifferent different solutions right for\\nsure you can discuss about it in your\\ninterview and that is going to\\nlike uh that is going to be a point for\\nyou where you can crack an interview and\\nis in the easiest possible way right\\nthis is what i have seen from my\\nexperience right and i'm just trying to\\nshare my experience with all of you\\nthat's it\\nso here then you can come for the resume\\nbuilding and then slowly gradually so\\nyou can start exploring all of these\\nthings whether it's a language again not\\nin depth maybe as an overview maybe\\nmachine learning algorithms so maybe\\nlike a databases maybe like an analysis\\npart maybe a big data site so you can\\nstart exploring each and everything\\nafter that one so that is something\\nwhich is going to like give you a\\ncapability to make a transition again\\ni'm going to summarize each and\\neverything right so summary wise first\\nof all you are supposed to look into a\\nvery first thing called as dsar again\\nit's a lengthy session but i believe you\\nwill enjoy it for sure now the second\\nthing is you are supposed to look into\\nai ops the third part is you are\\nsupposed to look into a data science\\nmaster's program right data science\\nmaster's program so you can just look\\ninto it and just try to take an overview\\ni'm not saying that go in depth practice\\neach and everything solve all the\\nassignments solve all the problem and\\nthen go for the job no\\nit is going to create an headache for\\nyou so it's better move in this way so\\nthat you will be able to get a point to\\ndiscuss plus a broader overview and idea\\nand understanding you will be able to\\nget and then go for the 30 days\\ninterview preparation because there's 30\\ndays\\ninterview preparation so i have already\\ndiscussed about so many questions\\nhundreds and hundreds of questions\\nmulti-hundred questions is already\\ndiscussed even architecture and designs\\nare discussed over there so that is\\ngoing to help you out a lot\\nin a short term as well as in a long\\nterm i hope uh you are able to\\nunderstand that what you should do and\\nwhat you are not supposed to do right\\nand yes after that come for the resume\\ndiscussion come for a mock interview\\nuh come for the\\nassessments and we can we can tell you\\nover here that okay fine so here you are\\nlagging and here you are clear and you\\ncan you can move ahead this is my advice\\nand this is my data science roadmap for\\nsenior people with that thank you so\\nmuch see you again in my next lecture\\nthank you\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': 'Raw Data File_6.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '8dbf45c8e5c635ff1d3773d0d4bc70ac'}>, <Document: {'content': \"hello everyone welcome back and today\\ni'm going to talk about a data\\nengineering roadmap let's suppose i'm a\\nperson and who is trying to get into a\\ndata engineering site or maybe i'm\\ntrying to join some organization i'm\\ntrying to make a transition into some of\\nthe organization as a big data engineer\\nso how i'm supposed to do a preparation\\nbecause there was a time when i was\\nlike uh going through a similar kind of\\na situation seven or eight years back so\\nwhen i was trying to do a transition\\nfrom sap to big data so because of this\\nlack of road map lack of resources i had\\nstruggled a lot so i thought of creating\\nthis particular video so that it is\\ngoing to help you out a lot\\nand for sure we all can do a transition\\ninto a data engineering site if and only\\nif we are going to work really really\\nhard for couple of months not for a year\\nnot for a decade just for a couple of\\nmonths so listen out entire stack\\ncarefully try to do one by one each and\\neverything that i'm going to discuss and\\nthen for sure you will be able to make a\\ntransition after your hard work so let's\\nsuppose if i'm trying to join some\\norganization as a data engineer or big\\ndata which is for sure a need you can go\\nto linkedin and you can try to check how\\nmany number of job opportunities are\\navailable and for sure it's very very\\nhigh it's in a lag so as a data engineer\\nor as a big data engineer there are so\\nmany opportunities which is available to\\nall of us so let's suppose if i'm trying\\nto get into a data engineering site so a\\nvery first thing which i will try to\\nfocus over here is i will try to\\nunderstand hadoop so if i'll talk about\\na number one so it's going to be\\nhadoop\\nhadoop is very very important it's a\\ndistributed file system which is called\\nas hdfs hadoop distributed file system\\nwhich has been derived from gdfs a\\ngoogle file system or google distributed\\nfile system gfs file system so hadoop\\nand\\nand a concept behind what is our meaning\\nof distributed computation what is the\\nmeaning of a parallel computation so all\\nof these things are very very important\\nso you are supposed to understand an\\narchitecture behind a hadoop system\\nunless and until you are not going to\\nunderstand this architecture behind a\\nhadoop system it is going to create an\\nissue in your interview so you are\\nsupposed to understand a complete\\ndistributed computation system\\narchitecture just an architecture try to\\nunderstand now so five or six years back\\nor seven years back when i was trying to\\ndo a preparation so at that point of a\\ntime even map reduce is import map\\nreduce was important but nowadays map\\nreduce is not important so you can just\\ntry to skip that particular part because\\nnowadays no one is using map reduce at\\nall so after hadoop so if i'll talk\\nabout seven year back so we used to\\nstudy a map reduce and we used to do a\\ncoding by using maybe a java maybe by\\nusing a scala but nowadays map reduce is\\nnot a relevant one because there are\\nsome powerful engine which is available\\nin a market which can work much much\\nbetter than a mapreduce and that too in\\na very optimized way so you are not\\nsupposed to touch map reduce again if\\ni'm talking about a hadoop distributed\\nsystem so maybe you can go ahead with a\\n2.x or 3 dot x so try to study these\\nsystem try to study a resource manager\\nlike a yarn or resource this kind of a\\nresource manager you are supposed to\\nunderstand try to understand how\\nreplication factor will be implemented\\ntry to understand again a multiple\\ncomponent which comes under hadoop\\nitself so what i'm trying to say over\\nhere is a complete hdfs file system you\\nare supposed to understand now when you\\nare trying to understand this hadoop\\nsystem a hadoop ecosystem\\nright at the same point of a time you\\ncan try to explore and you can try to do\\na practical implementations as well by\\nusing maybe a cloud data distributed\\nenvironment or maybe by using the hdp\\nhortonwork distributed platform so you\\ncan try to use cloud data or you can try\\nto use hdp hotend work nowadays now both\\nare same so you can try to use either of\\nthis and then you can try to each\\nimplement each and everything so in this\\nway for sure you will be able to get a\\npractical implementation of this entire\\nhdfs file system it's just a file system\\nso no need to worry about it but\\nat the same point of a time a second\\nthing which is important is a basic of\\nbasic of\\nlinux\\ncommand again this is important because\\nwhen you are going to deal with the sdfs\\nsystem at that point of a time so for\\nsure you are supposed to know so how to\\ncopy a file from one part to another\\npath so how to start one services how to\\nstop other services how to create a\\ndirectory and many more things is\\nimportant again i'm not asking you to\\nget into a depth of it if you are aware\\nabout uh like a detail of a linux system\\nand its command that's completely fine\\nbut at least a basic of a linux command\\nis very very important so just make sure\\nthat you know all of this basic command\\nat least 2025 number of commands and\\nthen it's okay okay to go ahead with a\\ndifferent different component which may\\ncome into our picture now a very third\\nthing which i would like to recommend\\nyou over here is a language\\nso language wise you can opt for\\nthree languages again you can opt for\\nmore but what i will advise you is to go\\nahead with either of these languages so\\nmaybe\\na java maybe\\nscala or maybe you can go ahead with\\npython many of us think that that java\\ncan be a complex one a complex to learn\\ncomplex to implement that's completely\\nfine scala may be a complex one complex\\nto learn complex to implement so in that\\ncase you can opt for a python because\\nnowadays whatever system that you are\\ngoing to use whatever services that you\\nare going to use you can and you will be\\nable to find out a python apis and\\npython library for each and everything\\nso just make sure language is a enabler\\nit is going to enable you to write a\\ncode it is going to enable you to design\\na system but nothing more than that so\\nyou are going to offer java scala or\\npython that's completely fine either of\\nthese things are going to work for you\\nand for sure you will be able to do an\\nimplementation but yes don't\\nmiss a language part because if you are\\ngoing to join any organization on a\\ntechnical side you can't miss the\\nlanguage part at all that is very very\\nimportant believe me so you are supposed\\nto understand and you should know a\\nlanguage path at least till a\\nintermediate label i'm not asking you to\\nget a mastery into any of the languages\\nbut at least till intermediate path you\\nare supposed to understand a language\\nside now a next thing which i would like\\nyou to understand\\nfor this data engineering part is\\na high\\nso again hive is a very important tool\\nfor a data warehousing which is an\\nintegrated part of your hadoop ecosystem\\nwhenever you are going to install\\nso like let's suppose if i'm using a\\ncloud database distributed environment\\nor maybe emr if i'm going to use or\\nmaybe i'm going to use hot and work so\\nin all of these environments you will be\\nable to find out hive which is installed\\nif you are going to do a custom\\ninstallation\\nso yes hive as a service you will be you\\nare supposed to install separately but\\nagain that's that's it's mentally and if\\na person is having an idea about a\\nsequel a basic of sql command so in that\\ncase\\nyou will be able to understand hql hive\\nquery language in an easiest possible\\nway again it is not going to give you\\nmuch pain because it's almost similar to\\nsql i'm not saying that it's exactly as\\nsequel but yes command wise syntax is\\nwise if you are unable to understand sql\\ni believe you can learn all of these\\nthings easily and again you will be able\\nto do a comparison as well in between\\nhive and a sequel so where i'm supposed\\nto use hive or where i'm supposed to use\\na sequel and easily you will be able to\\ndo an implementation so hype is very\\nvery important if i'm talking about a\\ndata engineering site because almost in\\nevery project we are using hive you\\nwon't be able to find out even a single\\nproject where we are not using hive or\\nits equivalence so everywhere it is been\\nused so just keep these things in our\\nmind that i should know hive now some\\npeople say that even pig latins are\\nrequired but i will not recommend you a\\nbig latin because in today's environment\\npig is not required so yes a seven year\\nback when i was trying to learn so pig\\nwas important believe me at that point\\nof a time so in every interview people\\nuse this to ask multiple commands from\\nthis side but nowadays don't worry no\\none is going to ask you any kind of a\\nquestion on a big site right even a\\ntheoretical or practical no one is going\\nto ask you at all so just chill out and\\nuh don't take attention about this big\\nthings now\\nuh if i know hype so for sure i will be\\nable to understand uh impala so again\\nimpala is almost equivalent to a hype\\nand it's not a big deal to learn impala\\nat all so it's equivalent to high and\\nhype is almost equivalent to a sequel\\nagain command-wise not architecture and\\ndesign-wise so it's been used for a\\ndifferent purposes for sure but yeah you\\nwill be able to understand in the\\neasiest possible way now the next thing\\nthat you are supposed to know is that\\nfifth number thing is uh maybe flume\\nscoop\\nor maybe\\nyou can try to learn knife\\nso plume scoop and nifi so all of these\\ntools are nothing but all of these\\nservices are nothing but which has been\\nis been used for doing a data transfer\\nfrom one system to another system so\\njust for transferring a data let's\\nsuppose i'm supposed to transfer data\\nfrom a sequel system to oop this hadoop\\nsystem so in that case maybe i can try\\nto go ahead with the scoop if i'm\\nlooking for a file transfer i can try to\\nlook for a flume if i'm looking for\\nevery kind of a transfer so i believe\\nnifi is a beautiful and powerful and\\nlight-weighted tool which is available\\nin a market and yes i will try to go\\nahead with a apache an i5 or maybe a\\nscoop or maybe a flume so all of these\\nthree tools are required these three\\ntechnologies are required on your\\nlike a data transfer site so data\\nwarehousing site hive is required\\nlanguage wise java scala or python\\neither of these\\nyou can pick and choose basic objects is\\nrequired hdfs system is required fluid\\nscoop and nifi is required on this side\\nagain if i'm talking about a database\\nsite\\nnosql database site so hbase is very\\nvery important database it's a very very\\nimportant believe me so you are supposed\\nto understand this edge base unless and\\nuntil you are not going to understand\\nhbase so it is going to create a lot of\\nproblem for you so make sure that you\\nshould know hbase it's been used on top\\nof hdfs file system and it is going to\\ngive you so much of advantages when you\\nwill try to draw or when you will try to\\nbuild a dashboard on top of your final\\ndata set or whenever you are dealing\\nwith a lot of financial data set and you\\nare trying to do a data search based on\\nthe indexes so hbase is again a very\\nvery important tool which is required or\\nit's a nosql based database which is\\nrequired for all of us\\nnow if i'll talk about maybe a seventh\\nstack over here which is a very very\\nimportant stack that you are supposed to\\nknow is called as s p\\na r k it's a in memory computation\\nenzyme a very powerful one\\nright a very powerful\\nin memory computation engine and that is\\na spark and a spark there are so many\\nadvantages you will be able to see you\\nwill be able to get with respect to a\\nspark so here you will be able to find\\nout maybe a spark and a spark sql spark\\nfor the streaming spark machine learning\\nlibraries spark even nlps are available\\nfrom a snowflake lab so again there are\\nmultiple variants of spark which you can\\ntry to find out for example so spark sql\\nor a spark ml lib you can try to find\\nout a spark\\nstreaming you can try to find out so you\\nare supposed to know each and everything\\nnow let's suppose if i'm aware about\\nspark and again a spark provides you a\\nflexibility to write a code by using a\\njava scala python or our programming\\nlanguages some of the apis are not\\navailable in our programming languages\\nbut yes languages are just a language\\nlike i said it's just an enabler it is\\ngoing to give you a capabilities to\\nmaybe replicate or build a system right\\nso it's completely fine doesn't matter\\nfor me which language i'm going to pick\\nand choose the concept is very very\\nimportant\\nand here a concept of a core spark\\nconcept of spark sql ml lib streaming\\nall of these things are very very\\nimportant now the eighth part which i\\nwould like to highlight over here is a\\nscheduler side so scenario wise you can\\ntry to use maybe a\\nug or you can try to use\\nairflow\\nso oozy is a xml based scheduler so by\\nwhich you will be able to schedule a job\\nat a particular time stamp and then it\\nis going to run a job in an automated\\nway and uh ooji is basically a xml based\\nxml based file system based scheduler\\nthat you can try to find out and any\\nkind of a job if whether it's a linux\\njob whether it's a spark related job\\nwhether it's a hype job whether it's a\\nflume job a scoop job\\nyou will be able to schedule with the\\nhelp of og and its alternative is an\\nairflow so airflow provides you a flavor\\nof python so here you can try to write\\nyour script not in an xml file but\\ninstead of writing a script in xml file\\nyou can write your like a complete\\nscheduler by using just a airflow by\\nusing a language python right so nothing\\ncan be more amazing than that so if i'm\\nworking with python i believe i will be\\nlike a choosing i will be going for like\\na airflow which is which is anyhow going\\nto my preferred choice so uj and airflow\\nthis is what you are supposed to know so\\nthese are the technology stack which is\\nvery very important it's a bare minimum\\ntechnology stack which is required now\\nif i'm going to talk about another stack\\nso yes uh for streaming purposes you\\nneed kafka kafka is again important\\nnowadays\\nkafka is very very important if you are\\nlooking for a streaming right and kafka\\nand spark integration and scheduling\\nthose things with the help of ooji and\\nairflow so nowadays we are almost using\\nthis kind of a stack everywhere in our\\nmarket in almost every project every big\\ndata engineering project so we are\\ntrying to use it so yes kafka is\\nimportant and again architecture of\\nkafka is very very important\\nimplementation creating a producer and\\nlike a consumer is very very important\\nand multiple consumers are very very\\nimportant and dealing with a streaming\\ndata set a batch data set or maybe a\\nmini batch data set is very very\\nimportant so all of these things you are\\nsupposed to know anyhow so this is a\\nbare minimum requirement guys\\nunless and until you are not aware about\\nall of this stack it is going to be\\ndifficult for you to get into a data\\nengineering site a bare minimum\\nrequirement believe me hadoop basic of\\nlinux any one language hive floom scoop\\nnifi either of this hbase spark inside\\nspark sequel mlm streaming uj airflow\\nfrom a scheduling site and kafka from a\\nstreaming site so all of these stacks\\nare important now let's suppose if i'm\\naware about all of these stacks then\\nwhat i will do is then i will go ahead\\nwith the resume a\\ndiscussion\\nso yes in your one year on platform\\nresume discussions is already available\\nso you can raise your request by using a\\none-year-old platform and you can come\\nfor the resume discussion but before\\ncoming for the resume discussion you are\\nsupposed to do our projects because\\ninside your resume what you are going to\\nwrite your experience and your projects\\nnow if i'll talk about a project so\\nalways try to build a pipeline based\\nproject so pipeline based project means\\nlet's suppose there is a data source so\\nfrom there how i am going to connect\\nfrom a multiple data sources how i am\\ngoing to filter out all of these\\nrequired informations how i am going to\\nperform a different different kind of\\ntransformation operation different\\ndifferent kind of a load operations and\\nthen finally how i'm going to dump my\\ndata set into my databasing solution or\\nmaybe into a databases so this kind of a\\npipelining project is required so where\\nin one single project you will end up\\nusing this entire things and project\\nalong with a deployment and scheduler is\\nvery very important right so i'm not\\ntalking about the op side but yes this\\nis the berman requirement that you are\\nsupposed to fulfill so you can come for\\nthe resume discussions you can do a\\nproject which is available inside your\\ndashboard and then yes you will be\\neligible for applying for a job in a\\nmarket which is available on a different\\ndifferent platforms so this is a basic\\nroadmap i would say\\nin my next data engineering roadmap so\\ni'm going to talk about a data\\nengineering roadmap\\nin\\ndepth so if you have like this video so\\nyou can give a comment and then you can\\nlet me know that\\nwhether this input is useful for all of\\nyou or not if not for sure so anyhow i\\ntold you that in my next video so again\\ni'm going to drill down each and\\neverything in on a micro label and i'm\\ngoing to explain you so why this\\ncomponent is required and why that\\ncomponent is not required so in this way\\ni'll try to give you explanation till\\nthen thank you so much and see you again\\nin my next session thank you so much\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': 'Raw Data File_6.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id':
